_I am looking for a way to upload videos to Instagram from desktop. Do you know any web apps that can do that?_

Since the release of Instagram V4.1, users finally get the ability to **upload video to Instagram** from iPhone that is recorded with the phone's camera.

## Part 2: How to post Video to Instagram from Windows/macOS

To post videos on Instagram from computer/desktop, there are mainly two ways to go: share videos to Instagram from computer with the use of mobile phones or share video on Instagram from computer directly with a third-party Instagram video uploader. (For those who want to download photos from Mac/PC to Instagram, there are also websites that may help like deskgram.com.)

### A. Ways to Sync Videos from Computer to Mobile Device 

The methods below involve the use of a smartphone, namely, after you edit the video with the Instagram video uploader mentioned in Section B, Part 1, you simply need to get the video from computer to smartphone and share video on Instagram from camera roll as usual. This is preferable for those who don't want to install any program. Below are a few workarounds to do it: 

![Upload video to Instagram from computer](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/instagram-upload-2.jpg)

**1\. No.1 Fast Speed to Import videos from computer to iPhone iPad** 

After your video is ready, you can transfer the video to iPhone iPad from Mac/PC for Instagram posting. Instead of the complicated iTunes, the alternative [**MacX MediaTrans**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) does this job even better. It will help you easily transfer videos (any format) from computer to iPhone iPad using auto video conversion feature with only 3 clicks. Auto compress and reduce file size for you, too.

**2\. Send the video to yours via Email**

This is the most common way to sync computer videos to mobile device: email the video to your account, download the video from the email app on your iPhone/Android and then you can start to post video files to Instagram from the camera roll. The drawback lies in the file size that may be limited by the email.

**3\. Add videos to device via Dropbox or Google Drive** 

There are many similar service to send computer files to smartphones like AirDrop, but Google Drive and Dropbox are recommended as the best cloud ways to save the computer videos on smartphones. They are easy to use and will store photos, docs, files and videos. Note that with Google Drive, you can't save the videos in camera roll. But you can easily post videos on Instagram with Dropbox from the camera roll. 

**4\. Connect computer to smartphones for transfer**

The last way is simple and everyone will know. Connect your Android/iOS devices to your computer using the USB cable. Transfer the video you'd want to put to Instagram to the smartphones. Then share video on Instagram from camera roll in usual way.

After you use the above methods to sync videos to your mobile device, then you can open Instagram and post video to Instagram now.

### B. Publish video to Instagram from Computer via desktop application

![How to upload to Instagram from PC/Mac directly](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/instagram-upload-1.jpg) 

As the Instagram app is limited to mobiles only, here are many desktop applications that can fill this gap. Among those computer Instagram videos uploading tools, we recommend you **Gramblr** (or Bluestacks). This Instagram video uploading works seamlessly on Windows (10), Mac and Linux, allowing users to share to Instagram from PC/Mac directly without the need of a smartphone! (Instagram doen't allow third-party tools, so use it on your own risks) The process to upload videos from computer to Instagram with it is quite simple:

1. Download Gramblr and run it. Sign in to Instagram.
2. Choose the video/photo you would like to put to Instagram.
3. Gramblr will redirect you to "Caption." Add a caption if you wish.
4. Click Upload.
