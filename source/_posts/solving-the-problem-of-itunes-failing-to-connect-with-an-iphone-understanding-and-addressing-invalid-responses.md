## How to Fix iTunes Invalid Response Error When Connecting iPhone

### 1\. Update iTunes and iOS to the latest version 

The invalid response error can be as a result of the older iTunes that isn't compatible with the current iOS version on your iPhone or iPad. According to Apple, it no longer supports syncing your iOS 17-based iPhone iPad with iTunes version older than 12.8\. So please go the <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201352> to update to the latest iTunes version. 

### 2\. Keep abreast with corresponding OSX version

Your iPhone iPad running on iOS 17 requires iTunes 12.8 or later and in turn requires a Mac running at least macOS 10.11.6 El Capitan or later to sync and backup with iTunes. So it is advised to upgrade your computer to the required operating system if necessary. If you are not running the newer OS you will be unable to sync iPhone to your present Mac and will possibly run into iTunes invalid response error received from the device iPhone. 

**• macOS:** Mac App Store > Updates. Make sure that you have the latest version of macOS installed.

**• Windows:** Read this support documentation. Make sure that you have all updates downloaded and installed.

Please keep in mind newer OS such as macOS Big Sur may run slower on older Mac computers and require additional RAM (8GB is recommended and 4GB is the minimum requirement). So big jump to newer system version likely leads to bad compatibility with old software.

### 3\. Check your USB connection. 

Bad USB connection is responsible for the "iTunes could not connect to this iPhone because an invalid response", "[iTunes not recognizing iPhone issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)" and other errors like [iTunes error code 0xe8000065](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). To resolve the issue, try a different USB port (Generally, the port on the back of the computer is favorable if your computer isn't a latop), USB 30-pin dock-connector cable, make sure to have a good connection of USB to computer, put a USB 2.0 hub between the iPhone and the computer.

### 4\. Turn off security software

Sometimes additional security software or antivirus on Mac may have an influence on the device restart. You can eliminate the third-party security software conflict to see if the invalid response from iPhone is resolved. 

### 5\. Other Possible Solutions to Fix Invalid Response Error 

1\. Unlock iPhone with your password, Touch ID or Face ID.

2\. Reboot iPhone and computer.

3\. Reset network settings: Settings > General > reset > reset network settings.

4\. Reinstall iTunes.

5\. Make sure the time and date on iPhone and computer are set correctly. 

6\. Restore from another computer and network.

7\. [Contact Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/contact), if you still see the invalid response from iPhone to iTunes error. 

8\. If the iTunes not connecting to iPhone error exists and the invalid response received from the iPhone message still pops up, please try another [iTunes alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to sync, backup and transfer iOS data.
