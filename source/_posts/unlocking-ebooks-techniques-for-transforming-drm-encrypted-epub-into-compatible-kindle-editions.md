### Why we convert DRM protected EPUB to Kindle

You know EPUB is one of the most common eBook formats. It's a free and open eBook standard format in eBook world. So you may find that if you purchased some books from bookstore like Google Play, rakuten Kobo, Nook, most of those files are in EPUB format.

But the problem is that after you downloaded these EPUB to your computer, transfer them to your Kindle devices, you find you can't open them. This is because Kindle doesn't support EPUB format.

And, in fact, there is another reason that prevents us reading EPUB on kindle. Most of EPUB eBooks are protected with DRM, some are with Adobe DRM, and others are with Nook DRM. Just because of the DRM problem, though we paid money, we can only read our files on dedicated devices. The reasons we convert DRM EPUB to Kindle format are as follows:

* We want to read EPUB books on Kindle devices
* Kindle doesn't supports EPUB format
* EPUB books are protected with DRM
