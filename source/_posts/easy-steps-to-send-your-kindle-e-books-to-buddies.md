If you haven't heard about the Amazon Kindle fire, you perhaps do not keep the pace of the times. It's one of the best ereaders.

When you purchased a nice eBook in Amazon Store, you are hooked immediately by this book and want to share it with your family or your best friends after you finish reading it without a break.

Oops, problem here. You can not share it with your family or friends! Because the book has DRM protection, they can only be read on your Kindle.

Relax, here we introduce you **4 methods to share Kindle books**.

[\- Use a Kindle DRM Removal to break the limitation;](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

[\- Share Kindle books in the same account;](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

[\- Share Kindle books by lending out;](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Method 1: Share books on kindle fire by removing Kindle DRM

Download and install Kindle DRM Removal. It **helps you remove DRM from Kindle books**, then you can copy your books to anywhere (for personal use please).

Tips: This screenshot is taking my new Kindle Paperwhite 4 as an example. If what you are using is Kindle Fire tablet, epubor ultimate can't help detect the tablets devices, please sync your books via Kindle desktop app, then choose "Kindle" icon at the left side of this software, add books that you want to remove the drm.

Now you can get ebooks that are free of DRM. Then just convert mobi format to ePub, and transfer them to other ereaders via USB or other ways you'd like.

### Method 2: Share Kindle Fire ebooks with the same account

Before you choose this method, please make sure the people you want to share the book with is very close to you.

As we know, an Amazon account can be authorized on 6 Kindle devices, which is the base of this method.

1 Your friend should de-register his Kindle.

2 Tell your Kindle ID & Password to your friend.

3 Your friend register his/her Kindle with your ID

4 Your books will show up on your friend's cloud, and he/she can sync the books now.

Attention: **Turn off** the **Whispersync Device Synchronization**  ([whispersync for Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)) if you are sharing Kindle books on different devices with the same account. Because it will automatically sync your last page read. Synchronization will also keep track of any bookmarks, highlights, or notes that you added, so you can view them on another device.

How to turn off?

 "amazon.com" --- "My Account" --- "Manage Your Content and Devices" (Formerly "Manage your Kindle")--"Device Synchronization (Whispersync Settings)".

![turn off whisper](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/turn-off-whisper.png)

Select "Off". Everything is done! 

### Method 3: Share Kindle Fire ebooks with friends by lending out

1 Check that if the book is able to be lent out. Publishers decide whether books can be loaned, so not all books will be available. Look under the product details of the book on your Kindle device. If the book can be loaned out, it will say "**Lending: Enabled**".

![Lending Books](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_Kindle-Lending.jpg "Kindle DRM Removal")

2 Go to the "Actions" menu and look for the link marked "**Loan this title**". As long as the book can be loaned, this link will be  
there.

![Loan Kindle Books](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C_Kindle-lending.png "Kindle DRM Removal")

3 Click "Loan this title."Fill in the following form with the name of the other Kindle owner and her email address.

4 Click "Send now." The book will be sent to the other user. **The loaned book will be available for 14 days**.

5 Click on the button "Get your loaned book now" on the Kindle receiving the book.

6 Choose the device you want the book to be put in and click "Accept."

### Method 4: Share Kindle books with Kindle Family Library

There is another easier and more convenient way for us to share our Kindle books, Amazon enables us share apps, books and audiobooks with family or friends. No need to lending out or share the same Amazon account.

We can set family library on our Kindle device, or set this online. Here I will introduce how to set it from Amazon official website, if yo don't have a Kindle eReader or Kindle Fire device, you can still have access to it online. 

1Enter Amazon official website, hover "Your Account" -->"Manage Your Content and Devices", sign in with your Amazon account. Then click "Settings", you can see the **"Households and Family Library"** item.

![share Kindle books with Kindle family library](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/housholds-and-family-library.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




2Click "Invite an Adult" button, then Amazon will let the invited adult enter his Amazon account information. Let your parner sit down at your computer and input his account.

![enter Amazon account](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/enter-amazon-account.png)

3After you verify account, you’ll have to agree to share your payment methods. It is required to enable the Family Library feature — or you can only manage “child profiles”.

![agree payment methods](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/family-library-features.png)

4After you agree, you’ll be able to choose to share which types of content with each other. 

![share kindle files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/select-share-types.png)

5Now you have linked the 2 adult accounts together. If you like, you can also create up to four child profiles.

6Amazon allows a full list of Kindle devices and app to access to the shared content, including Kindle eReaders, Kindle Fire tablets, as well as Kindle app for iPhone, iPad, Android, Win, Mac and the web. You can see the shared content from your partner's library under "Manage Your Content and Devices".

**Note:** To see the shared content on device, the option may not be enabled by default. If you cannot see the content on device, you have to click "Manage Your Content and Devices "-->"Your Devices", select each device. And check "Show (Partner Name)'s content" box under Family Library for each. Your partner have to do this for their devices on their own account, too.

Hello, I have a Kindle and I have bought all of my books from Amazon.   
 I just recently purchased my 90 year old mother a Kobo from a book store. I would like to share my Purchased Kindle ebooks with her. I have set up her Kobo in my name and email addresss.   
 Can I share my books with her and how?   
 Thank you for any help you can give me.

One needs a degree in computer science in order to figure how to use this IMO. But then I am only an average user without any interest in engineering detail drudgery... It should all work one two three and voila! How far the technology is still from that future point (sigh)...Rant over.

One you remove the DRM use a free program for your computer called Calibre to change the format to just about any ebook format out there.

I intended to put you a little observation so as to give thanks once again for your splendid suggestions you've shared on this page. It's really strangely open-handed with people like you to offer unreservedly exactly what most of us could have sold for an e book to earn some dough for their own end, most notably since you could have done it in the event you decided. These advice as well acted to provide a great way to realize that other people have similar dream like my personal own to find out a good deal more in regard to this matter. I'm certain there are several more pleasant opportunities up front for individuals that read carefully your blog.
