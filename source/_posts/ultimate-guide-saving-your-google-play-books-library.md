Google Play eBook store is one of the biggest online eBook stores where you can purchase eBooks. Nearly 90% eBook lovers have purchased eBooks from Google Play at least once. Is it safe to keep your purchased eBooks at your Google Account? I am not sure about this because owning a digital eBook is different from owning a real book which you can keep it at your bookshelf forever. For various reasons, you may lose the access to your purchased eBooks. That’s why we need to back up Google Play Books. Here you'll learn necessities of backing up Google Play books and how to backup Google Play books.

### 1\. The Necessities of Backing up Google Play Books

Apparently, people choose to back up their Google Play books for different reasons. From my own perspective, it is necessary to back up the Google Play books and the reasons can be concluded as follows.

1 Google Play service are not available in all countries. 

 Although Google Play keeps trying hard to expand Google Play Books internationally, but this service is still not available in many countries. You can check [Google Office website](https://support.google.com/books/partner/table/6052428) to see the supported country list. Even if you have purchased books in the Google Play book supported country but you cannot access this book from a country that the Google service is not available. If you travel or immigrate to a Google Play books unsupported country, you will lose the access to your purchase Google Play books even if you've already purchase them. If you have backed up these books to your PC/Mac, it is easy for you to read them at any country.

2 Google Play eBooks has device limit issue. 

As the developing of technology, most eBook lover own more than one digital devices, such as tablets, smartphone, laptop, eReaders and so on. It is hard for them to read eBooks on only one device. Here comes to the issue. You may encounter this error message **“E\_GOOGLE\_DEVICE\_LIMIT\_REACHED”** when you try to download Google Play books to multiple devices. It means you have reached the Google Play devices limits. 

But **what is the Google Play device limits**? The Google Play limit how many devices you can download Google Play books on at the same time. They do not give exactly numbers of how many devices, but if you have reached this limits, you are not able to download your Google Books any more. Here is a solution provided by Google Play store -- removing ebooks from one of your devices and downloading it on another. If you have backed up your eBooks, there is no need to worry about the device limits because you can copy your eBook backup to any device.

3 If the Google Play store shut down, you will lose your book. 

I know this possibility of shutting down Google Play store is really rarely, but we are not definitely sure that Google Play store will run forever. As far as I am concerned, there are plenty of eBook stores before Amazon and Google Play went out of business. As consequence, their servers are also went down. For customers who have not downloaded their copies of purchased eBooks, they will lose these eBooks forever. To avoid meeting the similar situation, backing up your Google Play books is the top priority.
