As we known, PRC file is one of the Mobipocket e-book formats. Like mobi, the PRC format is compatible with Kindle. And another Kindle format, AZW, is basically the Mobipocket format with a slightly different serial number scheme. In other words, Kindle supports these three formats directly.

But every coin has two sides. Kindle does really give us a wonderful reading experience, but it only allows us to read his books on Kindle devices or Kindle apps, not most portable reading devices. So once you want to read PRC contents freely on a computer or other electronic equipment, such as iPad, iPhone, Nexus 7, Sony e-Reader, Kobo, etc, the guide **[convert Kindle (MOBI/PRC/AZW) to PDF](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)** may become your concern for PDF is the common eBook format.

Here this article is going to tell you another easy way **how to convert PRC to PDF Calibre** because Calibre is a **free PRC to PDF converter**.

Just by 3 steps.

### Step1: Install and Launch Calibre

Firstly[download Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) and select a proper version for your PC. Here we select "Windows". Make sure your prc format books have been copied or downloaded on your computer. Then install and launch it.

### Step2: Add PRC eBook to Calibre

After you launched the soft, please click "Add books" button to add your Kindle PRC eBooks. Then you can see them on the center zone of the screen. You can also drag and drop your PRC files. Double click to open for preview.

But if it pops up a window as the image shows below, there is another necessary task you should do before prc to pdf conversion. You'd better remove the DRM protection from PRC books so that you can convert drm prc to pdf.

The best tool I strongly recommend is [DRM Removal](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/drm-removal-tools/) for it can not only remove DRM from prc, but also remove drm from mobi, AZW, AZW3.

Tips

Of course after you removed the prc drm, you have to add the decrypted prc files from your PC (at the output folder) to Calibre again.

Now you can transfer your converted prc books to your eReaders or Computer to have a happy reading.

Yes the conversion is free but may not be so convenient if your books are mostly protected by DRM. Here I would recommend [the Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) for you. Because it can not only convert prc to pdf, but also convert prc to Kindle including convert prc to mobi.

How long to convert a PRC file to PDF file normally? It took me more than 2 hours to convert one PRC file about 100 Mb to PDF, and not finished yet.

Hi,

 I guess it may because your file is a little, so it usually need to spending much time converting the format. Besides, sometimes, the conversion process of Calibre will be very slow.
