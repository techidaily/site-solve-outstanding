Audible Tips and Tricks

If you are a fan of Audible, you should not miss out these Audible tips and trips.

### Tip 1 Get two credits via the 30-Day free trial.

No matter whether you intend to continue the membership or not, registering for the 30-day free trial to receive two free credits is a smart move. Use these credits to purchase two Audible books before ending your trial, securing two free audiobooks. Why not give it a try? You have nothing to lose but gain two audiobooks for free.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### Tip 2Put your account on hold

When compared to canceling the membership, putting your account on hold emerges as a superior alternative. You have the option to suspend your account for up to three months each year. Throughout this period, you retain membership privileges such as enjoying your Audible books in your library, utilizing existing credits, and benefiting from store discounts. However, it's important to note that you won't receive one credit every month during the hold period. This way, you can keep your membership on hold if you prefer not to receive credits on a monthly basis.

### Tip 3 Ask for the silver membership

![audible silver membership](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-silver-membership-discountinued.png)

Updated 2024: The bad news is, the silver membership has been discountinued, so you cannot use thie Audible tip.

You may not easily find information about the silver membership because Audible intends to keep it somewhat secret, using it as a backup plan for user retention. There is no direct access to the silver subscription; you need to visit the [**Audible customer service page**](https://www.audible.com/mt/contactus/) and initiate a chat to request a downgrade to silver. Another method to enroll in the silver subscription is by attempting to cancel your membership. When you choose the option "cancel my subscription," you'll be prompted to select a reason. Opt for "_It's too expensive_" and proceed to the next page. You may then see options like the silver plan, cancelation, and free credit. Check the detailed information on Silver and Golden memberships.

| **Silver Membership** | Audible Silver Membership Plan is $14.00 **every other month**.  Get 1 audio credit every other month.  Save 30% on all audio every day.  Enjoy the Great Listen Guarantee. Members unsatisfied with their choice can return an audiobook for another title up to 1 year after purchase.  Rollover and keep up to 5 credits at a time for as long as your membership is active.  Receive advance notice of exclusive sales and promotions.  Enjoy a complimentary weekday audio subscription to The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal.  Unlimited streaming access to Audible Channels. |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Golden Membership** | The Gold Monthly membership is $14.95 per month.  1 credit per month.  Great Listen Guarantee. Members unsatisfied with their choice can return an audiobook for another title up to 1 year after purchase.  30% discount to get any Audible books.  Member-only sales.  Enjoy a complimentary weekday audio subscription to The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal.  Unlimited streaming access to Audible Channels.                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Tip 4 Subscribe Audible Escape to enjoy unlimited audiobook listening

### Tip 6 Spend 4 credits at once to get a $10 credit

If you accumulate 4 credits and spend them all at once, you'll receive a $10 credit.

Additionally, there are other credit-related deals available. For instance, there's an offer such as "[_Get a $10 coupon when you use 3 of your credits by June 26_](https://www.audible.com/ep/audiobook-deals)".

This is the Audible special offer page where you can find the best Audible deals. The available offers may vary at different times.

### Tip 7 Don’t Use Audible Credits if Audible Book is $14.95 or Less.

Since you have to pay for 14.95$ for Audible membership to get 1 credit, if you spend the credit on the audiobook less than 14.95$, it seems that you are not maximizing the value of the credit.

### Tip 8 Watch for Audible’s special deals.

Since Audible offers special deals and daily deals, you really should visit the site frequently to see what they are offering. 

**Sometime, you will come across 2-for-1 deals**. You can keep your credit until there's a 2-for-1 deal with the books you want. What is 2-for-1 deal? 2-for-1 deal means that you can purchase 2 audiobooks with 1 credit or purchase 2 audiobooks while get a third freeone.

**Add the Audible books you want to purchase to your wishlist.** You will get the notification when they are on sale. 

You need to sign up to get those deals to be emailed to you. So keep your eyes on your emails and do not miss out these special deals.

The Amazon match maker will scan your Kindle library and show different audio companion available for your Kindle eBooks.

 I find your Epubor Audible Converter absolutely most disappointing. I purchased the program and after trying numerous times found it impossible to work properly. I have been in touch with your Support a number of times as well but l just cannot get it to do the conversion. I have now uninstalled the program. Your Epubor Ultimate though works great on Ebooks and l use it often.
