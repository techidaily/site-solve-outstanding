The Amazon Kindle Store offers a wide variety of eBooks. However, as an Apple user, it's not always ideal to use Kindle for Mac or Kindle for iOS to read Kindle books. This is because the Kindle reader doesn't support the Apple Retina display, resulting in a pixelated and unsatisfactory reading experience that has persisted for over a year. Additionally, the Kindle app for iOS is slower than the iBooks app when it comes to synchronous reading. In contrast, the iBooks interface looks more like a library, giving you the feeling that your books are really on a bookshelf. Therefore, this guide will show you how to read DRMed Kindle books in iBooks/Apple Books.

### Step 1\. Download Kindle Books to Mac First

If you haven't installed [Kindle for Mac](http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/mac), please download and launch it first. Then, register it with your Amazon account. Go to 'Archived Items' in the library of the application software sidebar, and download or sync all your purchased books to your local computer.

_[Where can I find "My kindle Content" (my downloaded kindle books) on my Mac](https://www.epubor.com/where-are-kindle-books-stored-on-pcmacandroid.html#p2)_?

 Has Amazon hidden the location of these eBooks? Don't worry, go to _**"Kindle"->"Preference"->"Content Folder"**_ in the main menu. On my iMac, the location of Kindle books is _**.../Users/epubor/Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content/**_.

![where are kindle books stored on mac](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/my-kindle-content-mac-dmg.png)

Failed to find the 'My Kindle Content' folder on your Mac? A quick and easy way to find hidden files within a folder is to open the Finder and press "_**Command + Shift + .**_".

### Step 2\. Convert kindle books to Apple ePub or PDF

How to read protected Kindle books on iBooks? It may seem impossible to get protected Kindle books into iBooks due to various reasons.

 Firstly, most purchased Kindle books (.kfx, .azw4, .prc, .azw3, etc.) are protected by DRM. 

Secondly, the main formats of Amazon Kindle books are MOBI and AZW, which are not fully supported by iBooks, except for EPUB. 

Lastly, what about the notes and highlights you made on your Kindle books? No need to worry, they are stored at Amazon cloud. You can also [_export and and back up your kindle highlights_](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

[Epubor Ulitmate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) can convert almost all eBooks, including DRMed eBooks, to iBooks format, allowing us to keep all our converted books in the cloud. 

Download Epubor Ultimate for free:

Thank you for asking. Epubor software only works on Windows and Mac. It doesn't work on IOS tablet or mobile phone.

Is EPubor compatible with the latest versions of Kindle, EPub-DRM and a Mac OS beyond Mojave? I paid a LOT for EPubor as a family license, repeatedly, and it no longer works. I'm back to using Calibre, which is undoubtedly the basis for EPubor but it actually works...

“Ultimate.pkg” cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

This is due to the security settings for your Mac. By default your security preferences only allow installation of apps from the Mac App store and identified developers.

 To solve this problem, when the error message pop up, please click “Ok”. And then go to System Preferences&gt;Security & Privacy. On the General tab, click on the little lock icon in the lower left corner to unlock the general preference pane. Then select the Open Anyway radio button beneath Allow applications downloaded from.
