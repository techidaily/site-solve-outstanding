## Mastering eBook Reading: A Step-by-Step Guide for Your Nexus 7 Tablet

## How to Read eBooks on Nexus 7

![nexus 7 read ebooks](https://www.epubor.com/images/nexus7.jpg)The fact that Nexus 7 is the hottest Android Tablet is beyond dispute. It strikes Kindle Fire heavily with the more advanced hardware and the same price.

But when people want to read eBooks on Nexus 7, they found that **the built-in reading app only supports the eBooks purchased from Google Play** (and it began to support uploaded local DRM-free ePub book), which means we can't read the eBooks from Kindle, Nook, or some excellent third-party eBook Stores like FictionWise, Lulu, etc.

So we want to make this article an epic guide to introduce you how to read eBooks on Nexus 7.

**The first problem always comes to the DRM protection**. In the past, if you want to read an eBook you purchased from an eBook Store on the device you want, you have to figure out what DRM protects the eBook and how to bypass the protection and some other boring stuff.

Why reading a purchased eBook becomes a red tape? For those people who are not that skillful in computer, must they buy a Kindle to read books purchased in Amazon, buy a Nook to read B&N books and buy a Sony Reader to read Sony books? That is absolutely ridiculous.

For how to remove DRM from different kinds of eBooks, we've written many articles about this topic. So I don't want to be tedious here.

### Ultimate Converter makes the eBook DRM-free

**We strongly recommend you watch this video** to get the details of our strongest product, Epubor Ultimate. This is the best eBook converter for Nexus 7\. It can help you read Kindle AZW, Mobi, PRC, Topaz eBooks and Kobo/Nook/Sony ePub eBooks on your Nexus 7.

**Download the tool for free**:

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

(Making an eBook DRM-free is the **key-step** if you want to read non-Google-Play eBooks in Nexus 7.)

### Job hasn't been finished yet, Google sets an obstacle again

After getting the eBooks without DRM, now we can load them into the Nexus 7 and read it by the built-in reading app.

Oops, **Google says no**, you cannot do it. The Nexus 7 built-in reading app doesn't allow us to load eBooks from computer's hard drive to it, but only the eBooks purchased from Google Play. And if the eBooks you get are PDF, you can read them directly in Nexus 7, but believe me, you won't like reading an eBook in PDF format on a 7-inch screen. (Update: Google has made it possible to upload local DRM-free ePub PDF books to Google Play Books app, here is the [how-to guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).)

So the truth is, we spend more than $200 to buy the Nexus 7 but can only read the eBooks in Google Play? I don't want to offense Google, but the eBooks in Google Play indeed hardly meet our demands.

But don't worry, don't forget what we write this guide for.

### Break the chains, read eBooks on Nexus 7 as you want.

Apps you need to install:

* eBook Reading App ([Aldiko is recommended, because it can read purchased Google Books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/reader/))

#### **What you need to do:**

**1** Transfer the **DRM-free epub eBooks** to Nexus 7\. Plugin your Nexus 7 to computer with USB cable, then open the Internal storage you will see a "Download" folder. I recommend you copy and paste your books into this folder.

**2** Install Aldiko eBook Reader on your Nexus 7 by searching this app in Google Play where you can get it for free.

**3** Read the eBook by the reading app you installed. Run Aldiko, press "Files" in the home screen, then find the folder where you saved books, we put books in "Download" folder in 1st step. So we press "Download" folder on the screen then we can see the books tranferred before. Tap on the box right side of the item name to choose it, then press "IMPORT" in the upper right corner to get them into your Aldiko library. Now you can read ePub books on your Nexus 7 freely.

(Note: Step 1 is operated on your computer, Step 2&3 are operated on your Nexus 7\. In case you are not that familiar with computers and gadgets, I specially create a slide for you.)

#### **Don't know how to transfer eBooks to Nexus 7?**

**1** Plug your Nexus 7 to computer, and there will be a removable drive showing up in your computer, then you can copy & paste the files from your computer hard drive to Nexus 7.

**2** Install the Dropbox both on your computer and Nexus 7, then you can sync files with Dropbox(Nexus 7 should be connected to WIFI).

3 Install Calibre on your computer, put your eBooks into Calibre, then click "Start Content Server", then open the web browser in your Nexus 7, go to the url "Your IP:8080". Your IP address will show up as the image.

![calibre server](http://www.epubor.com/images/calibre-server.png)

For example, my IP address is 192.168.1.234, then I go to the url "192.168.1.234:8080". Now I can get my eBooks in the Calibre from computer to Nexus 7 via WIFI. The computer and Nexus 7 should be in the same WIFI environment.

### Which eBook format does Nexus 7 support?

For Nexus 7 built-in eBook reading app, you can read ePub and PDF eBooks, but the books can only be purchased from Google Play.  
If you want to load those downloaded eBooks from your computer to Nexus 7, you should install third-party eBook reading apps on the tablet, then you can enjoy those eBooks no matter they are ePub, Mobi, PDF or even Kindle AZW.

Don't know which reading app supports your downloaded books format?

##### Q: **How to download eBooks to Nexus 7?**

A: This question includes two aspects: download purchased Google Play books to Nexus 7, and download free books (or the books exist on your computer) to nexus 7.

**\-** For how to download purchased Google Play books: You should have a built-in app called [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books&hl=en) in your Nexus 7, once you enter the app and login your Google account, all your purchased books will be downloaded to your Nexus 7 automatically. If you don't have such an app, you can visit the Google Play App Market on your nexus 7 and search "Play Books app" then you can install it on your device.

**\-** For how to download free or existed book: For this issue we have listed you 3 ways in the content above, please scroll up and check the part "[transfer eBooks to Nexus 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)". If you have bookmarked some sites which offer you free ePub / PDF eBooks directly download, you can also simply visit these sites on Nexus 7 and download them to your device with the built-in web browser (Chrome for Android), then just find the book with file manager app (such as Astro File Manager) and open it with your favorite reading app.

##### Q: **How many eBooks will 8GB Nexus 7 hold?**

A: We assume each of your book takes 500kb space, and for a 8GB nexus 7 there are only 5.62GB availabe space (the system and built-in apps take 2.38GB). Therefore we can simply calculate the result: the 8GB Nexus 7 can hold around 11240 eBooks, while the 16GB Nexus 7 can hold around 27240 eBooks.

##### Q: **How to read PDF on Nexus 7?**

A: If you have read this guide carefully, you must have got the answer. If you are not satisfied with the built-in reading app, you can have some alternative options which are focusing on reading PDF. For instance: [Adobe Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader&feature=nav%5Fresult#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd), [Librera PDF Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foobnix.pdf.reader&feature=search%5Fresult#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5mb29ibml4LnBkZi5yZWFkZXIiXQ), [ezPDF Reader](http://download.cnet.com/ezPDF-Reader/3000-18497%5F4-75331783.html).

##### Q: **How to get Kindle eBooks on Nexus 7?**

A: - **Option One**: As Nexus 7 is an Android-based tablet, and Amazon offers an official Android reading app, therefore you can just install the Kindle for Android app on your Nexus 7\. Just search "Kindle" in Google Play app market where you can get it.

\- **Option Two**: If you don't like reading books throught Kindle app, then you need to convert your purchased Kindle books to DRM-free ePub books, so that you can read it with any app you like.

For converting purchased Kindle books to ePub, you can [refer to this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) and it can help you.

After you get the DRM free ePub books, all you need to do is transferring them to your Nexus 7\. We have provided you [3 ways to tranfer books to Nexus 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

##### Q: **Where to get Nexus 7 user manual or guide?**

A: You can get it for free in Google Play, [this link will direct you there](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gKmQD47OvCYC&rdid=book-gKmQD47OvCYC&rdot=1&source=gbs%5Fapi). And if you are non-USA user maybe you will meet problem in getting this book in Google Play, then please [download it through Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/86b7ds77twx04nq/Google%5FNexus%5F7%5FManual%5FGuide%5FBook%5FUser%5FGuide.pdf).

##### Q: **How to print from Nexus 7?**

##### Q: **Should I choose a Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HD?**

A: It depends, in my private point of view, if you often purchase contents (apps, music, video, books) in the official store, Kindle Fire HD would be your choice as Amazon online-store is much superior than Google Play. And if you want a better gadget, Nexus 7 won't make you down. Click here to check a [detailed comparison between Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Hi Taitui,  
 Sorry for the late reply.  
 Our product "Epubor Ultimate" works perfect on Amazon Kindle books.  
 You only need to load the Kindle books to the software, then choose "ePub" as the output format. Then transfer the converted ePub to your Nexus 7(same for all Android device), then open the ePub with eBook reading apps like Aldiko, etc.

I have to agree - I spend $250 for a device and the built in reader is hobbled? Not cool. And from what I am seeing, the most recent versions of Aldiko are not showered in glory. I guess if I want to read that tech manual, I will stay with my iPad - at least I can read it with the default reader...good post about doing something that should not require this much working around the system.

Hi David,  
 I couldn't agree more about your feedback. And in fact, for most Android device, we will install many third-party apps to instead the built-ins, from ebook reading apps to web-browsers, etc.  
 I didn't upgrade my Aldiko to the latest version, but there are so many other reading apps on Android, I believe there always is one app can meet your demand. :)  
 And the iPad default reading app is pretty handy, I use it to read on iPad, either.  
 However, thanks again for your nice comment. Cheers!
