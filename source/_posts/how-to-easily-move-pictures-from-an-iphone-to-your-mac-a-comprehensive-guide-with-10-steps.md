You can choose specific folders or albums to transfer and preview your photos before importing. iMazing also provides options for creating backups, managing app data, and more. Follow the straightforward way to transfer photos from iPhone to Mac via iMazing:

Step 1\. Download and install iMazing on your Mac. You can find the app on the iMazing website (https://imazing.com/). Afterwards, connect your iPhone to your Mac using a USB cable. Make sure to unlock your iPhone and trust the computer if prompted.

Step 2\. Open the iMazing application on your Mac. In the iMazing main window, you will see your connected iPhone listed on the left sidebar. Click on it to select your device.

Step 3\. In the device management screen, click on the "Photos" section, which is usually located in the left sidebar under your device's name. iMazing will display your iPhone's photos and albums. You can opt for the images or albums you want to sync to your Mac.

Step 4\. Click the "Export to Folder" button to choose the destination folder on your Mac where you want to save the photos.

Step 5\. After selecting the photos and destination folder, click the "Export" button to initiate the sync process. You can monitor the progress in the iMazing window.

Once the transfer is complete, you can access the synced photos in the destination folder you specified.

You see, the above 10 ways are all available for transfer photos from iPhone to Mac. However, your option may be different according to your needs. For example, WinX is preferred for those who want to transfer all photos at fast speed and even convert HEIC to JPG. AirDrop, iPhoto, Image Capture are suitable for transferring specific photos at fast speed. iCloud depends more on WiFi connection. Email and Wechat both have size limit for photo transferring. USB cable offers a solid option for transferring photos, while you should always carry it. 

 Hope this article is helpful for you to bulk download photos from iPhone to MacBook or iMac without sweating. If you still have any problem on how to transfer iPhone live/4k photos to Mac, just [email us >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
