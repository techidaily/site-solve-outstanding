## Customer Testimonials

MacX iMKVmaker moves fast and does its job properly. A few click are all I need to start the conversion process. Everything is automatic. All I need to do is to choose the output format. It riped my DVD movies smoothly while keeping all the information of the DVD. Seems I don't need the original DVDs at all.

After a trial of MacX iMKVmaer, I found that it supports loading the protected DVD movies that can be not nbarely recognized by many other software , so I bought its full version with discount. It is works well more than I imagine. All my Disney animation or Paramount movies can be converted to MKV or my Apple devices without quality loss.
