You borrow some books from public library, you download them to your computer, then transfer them to your kindle device. Opps! You can't open them!

This is a common thing in our daily life. You may ask me why, and how to. Don't worry! Just keep reading to get your acsm readable on your kindle devices.

Please note that if you want to read acsm file on kindle , you must **convert acsm to kindle mobi format**. This is a necessary step.

### Why Should We Convert ACSM to Kindle Format

When you borrow or purchase ebookS from an online store or public library, what you probably download is an acsm file. It's not an actual ebook, but only a link with database, allowing a program to download the book. ACSM file always comes with DRM.![drm acsm](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/acsm-drm.jpg)

ACSM is the short name of Adobe Content Server Manager, so you know that acsm is produced by Adobe. In fact, Adobe Digital Editions is the only program that has the right to open acsm file. When ADE see the acsm file, it will automatically download acsm to PDF or EPUB format. But ADE can be only installed on computer, Windows or Mac, but not kindle. So here comes **the reason 1: acsm file can be opened only on computer with ADE**.

Additionally, let's talk about kindle device restrictions. We know reading kindle books on Kindle is enjoyable. However, this also brings a problem -- we can't read any ebooks if they are not kindle format. But our acsm file can only be downloaded to epub or pdf. In a word, **the reason 2 is that Kindle devices don't support acsm format**.

Two reasons have explained clearly now, right?

* ACSM can only be opened with ADE, but ADE can't be installed on Kindle.
* ACSM format is not readable on Kindle.

So we must convert acsm file to kindle format. As mobi is the native kindle format, so I recommend you convert acsm to mobi.

### How to Convert ACSM File to Kindle Mobi?

This part I will show you how to convert ACSM to Kindle Mobi.

#### Step 1: Learn how to open acsm file

1 Install Adobe Digital Editions

ACSM file can only be opened with ADE on computer, so the first thing we have to do is to [download and install ADE](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html).

2 Authorize Adobe ID

After you get it installed, a window will pop up asking you to register an Adobe account, then authorize your ADE with this Adobe account.

3 Open acsm with ADE

Find your acsm file you downloaded on your computer. Then double-click the acsm file you downloaded, by default it will be opened with ADE. If not, right-click the acsm file and select "open with"--"Adobe Digital Editions".

![open acsm with ade](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-acsm-with-ade.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

After you opened acsm with ADE, you will find that these acsm files have been converted to .epub or .pdf format. You can get them from the output path of ADE:

****For Windows:** ...\\My Documents (Documents)\\My Digital Editions ...  
**For Mac**: Users/Your computer name/Digital Editions ...

#### Step 2: Convert acsm to kindle mobi with Epubor Ultimate

In Step 1 we have opened our acsm files, and converted them to epub or pdf in ADE. Then we need to use a acsm to kindle covnerter [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/).

1Download Epubor Ultimate for free

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

2Add acsm to the tool

Get Epubor Ultimate started. If your acsm files can be opened with ADE as step 1 shows, this tool will find your files automatically, and list them on the left side below "ADE" icon. All you have to do is just to drag them to the right area.

![add acsm to remove drm](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-acsm-drm.jpg)

As the image shows, it will remove the DRM from acsm files automatically (if they have). You can see the "decrypted".

3Convert Adobe ACSM to Mobi.

Set common "mobi" as the output format. Or you can also select azw3 as the output because Kindle also supports this format well.

![acsm to kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/acsm-to-mobi.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Then click on "Convert to " button, the conversion start soon, and then will complete fast.

#### Step 3: Transfer mobi to Kindle devices

From the decrypted output folder, you can see your converted mobi files. The left job is to transfer them to your kindle devices via USB connection or send-to-kindle service. From the homepage of your kindle you will see your new added files are listed. They are ready for you to open them for a happy reading.

Important: If you would like to transfer acsm to Kindle device **via USB**, we recommend you convert adobe to Mobi format. But please note that, Amazon Kindle has discontinued the Mobi/azw format supporting to its [Send to Kindle service](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). In other words, we recommend you convert acsm to ePub or kindle azw3 format for adobe on kindle reading.

word of warning: it works, but unless you pay $25 then it will only give you a converted preview of the book (20% of it) and leave out the rest. wow what a massive waste of time, only to get stuck here.

A suggestion here, rather than converting 20% of each book, why not just allow a limited number of conversion and varieties for the trail period? A one month of 30 days of trail will be enough.(Ex. 3-5 conversions daily and hence limiting customers' ability to test out large numbers of conversions. Epub-Mobi, PDF- Word etc.) Or perhaps, giving people the choice of unlocking premium to expand their number of converting and advance into some useful tools? Otherwise, it creates a pressure for people to "have" to purchase it and becomes a useless installation that some people will instantly uninstall after they realize that there isn't even the space for experimentation and expectations. Not mentioning the fact that the software has a price wouldn't have been a problem have you gave people a chance before they gave your team a chance. A 20% conversion of each file transmit the idea of making profit from the developers way too clearly for its own good.

 The fact that all the resources costs money is nothing costumers don't understand, but that one move made the software seems a bit too petty. Also decreases the chance of anybody promoting and attracting more traffic to your app.

The first option would be for you to remove that book from a device it's currently downloaded on if possible, then try to re-download the book afterwards on the new device in question.  
 If you are unable to try the first option, or if it doesn't work, the next option would be for google community support team to reset the device limit in your account. Tell them your books' ISBN or Google books ID and permit them to reset the device limit. This will remove all of your books from your devices associated with this account. You would be able to re-download the books again afterwards.
