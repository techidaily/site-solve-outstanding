As an Android tablet, Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD/HDX will receive occasional updates to add new features and improve security. Most of the time, these updates happen automatically and you can **update your Kindle Fire automatically**. However, everything has an exception. Sometime, you may miss the update notification but want to update your Kindle tablet. In this situation, you have to **update your Kindle Fire manually**.

###  Check Software Version of Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD/HDX

In case you might have installed the latest update, it is better for you to check the installed version on your Kindle device. Swipe down from the top of the screen, and tap _Settings_. Select _Device Options_ and then _System Update_. In the _System Updates_, you will see the message " _Your device is running Fire OS <Version>_" if you already have the latest version installed. You can also check the following form or go to[Amazon Fire & Kindle Software Updates](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200529680&tag=aboutcom02lifewire-20) to see whether your Kindle device has installed the latest version or not.

### Update Kindle Fire& Kindle Fire HD/HDX Automatically

Usually, if you keep the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD/HDX connected to wifi, it will update by itself when a new update is available.

### Update Kindle Fire& Kindle Fire HD/HDX Manually

If your Kindle Fire has not updated by itself, there are also other ways to update it: updating Kindle Fire(HD/HDX) on Kindle device and updating by using the computer.

#### Update Kindle Fire(HD/HDX) Directly on Device 

 I guess most of you guys will choose to update Kindle Fire and Fire HD/HDX by this way because it is much quicker than next method. Before updating, make sure your Kindle Fire(HD/HDX) has the internet connection and the battery level should not be less than 30%. Why? If you do not have the internet connection, the update can not be downloaded to your Kindle device. If the battery level is less than 30%, the update processing may be interrupted because of power off.

To trigger the update, you can go to _**Settings-->>Device Options-->>System update-->>Check Now/Update**_. The Update option will appear if the update file has been downloaded already. 

When the updates download completely, your device will restart to apply the update. After the restart, you will get a message saying "Installing system update".

#### Update Kindle Fire(HD/HDX) by Using Computer

If you do not want to update the Kindle Fire directly on the Kindle Fire, you can try this method. But please ensure you can connect your Kindle Fire to your computer at first.

**Step 1: Download the Kindle Update File**

Please [check the generation of your own Kindle Fire's device](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) at first before downloading the update files. Once you've known the generation of your Kindle device, you can go to **above form** to download the latest update for your Kindle Fire accordingly or you can visit [Amazon Fire & Kindle Software Updates](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200529680&tag=aboutcom02lifewire-20) page to get the update file.

**Step 2: Transfer the update to Kindle Fire(HD/HDX)**

Connect your Kindle Fire to your computer and find the device icon on your computer. 

For the **Kindle Fire of first and second generations**, click the Kindle Fire icon and go to the _Kindleupdates_ folder. Then copy downloaded update file to the _Kindleupdates_ folder and eject the Kindle device from your computer. 

For the Kindle Fire of the rest generations, copy the downloaded update file directly to the?**internal storage**?folder. Do not drop the update file into any other folder of internal storage.

**Step 3: Install the updates** 

Unlock the screen, and swipe down from the top of the screen, select _Settings-->>Device Options-->> System Updates-->>Update_ to begin the installation. Now your Kindle Fire will restart automatically and you will see "Installing System Update" on your screen.

Now you can check your Kindle Fire software version to see whether it is the latest or not. If it still has not updated to the latest version, you have two ways to update it now! If you have your Kindle Fire software updated, bugs will be fixed, performance will be improved and the new features will be added.

##### Q: Why can't I find the Kindle Fire on my Mac? I am using Mac computer.

A: If you are using a Mac computer with OSX 10.5 or above, you will need to install [Android File Transfer](https://dl.google.com/dl/androidjumper/mtp/current/androidfiletransfer.dmg), a free application, to complete the USB transfer.

##### Q: Why I can not Install the latest update 4.5.5.2? I am using the Kindle Fire HDX (3rd generation) and my software is 3.2.4.

A: If your Kindle device(3 generation) is running software version 3.2.4 or a previous version, you will need to download and install [software version 3.2.5](https://kindle-fire-updates.s3.amazonaws.com/update-kindle-13.3.2.5%5Fuser%5F325001120.bin) in order to download Fire OS 4.5.5.2.

##### Q: Why the update option is grayed out?

A: You may already have the latest update installed on your Kindle Fire. Check the version of your Kindle Fire before updating.

A: This may be caused by the update files being renamed incorrectly or duplicated existing. Connect your Kindle Fire to your computer, and check the update files in your device. Delete the duplicate file and ensure the name has “no trailing spaces or characters, such as (1), after the file name.”

##### Q: Why the previous software version number does not change to the latest one after updating?

Can I update manually my HDX 3rd generation with the 5.3.3.0 firmware from the HDX 4th generation? They have exactly the same hardware and I feel really upset I didn't receive the latest update for Alexa.
