### Method 1: Close Apps on Kindle Fire manually

To begin with, I would recommend you close these apps by yourself. Here is the steps.

Step 1: To reveal the menu, please swipe down from the top of the screen of your Kindle Fire. You will find "settings" in the menu. Just click it, and choose " Applications". All application installed on your Kindle fire will appear.

Step 2: Select “Manage All Applications" and tap "Third-Party Applications"(some time it will be "All applications"), in the drop-on list, select "Running Applications".

Step 3: All running Apps will display on your screen. Then select the Apps you want to closed, and tap "Force stop".

Step 4: It will pop up a dialogue, just selecet " OK" . The application has been closed successfully.

### Method 2: Close Apps on Kindle Fire by Task Manager 

 Besides closing Apps by yourself, you also can do it with task manager. Here are two popular task managers for your Kindle Fire.

#### 1, [ES Task Manager](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=es%20advanced%20task%20manager&c=apps&hl=en)

Es Task manager is one of the better designed apps to manage your device. It contains task killer, cache cleaner, power optimizer, start up manger and so on. It does the work of several programs allowing you to do.

You can go to the Google Play to download it directly to your Kindle Fire. Tap the icon to open it, you will see the following picture.

![ES Task Manger](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ES-Task-Manger-1.png)

Tap right arrow below "Kill All" , all running Apps on Your Kindle Fire will be listed on your screen. Touch the “X" at the right side of the running application to close it.

![ES Task manager](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ES-Task-manager-2.png)

You can see it is much easier than method 1, with less steps to shut down all running apps on your Kindle Fire. I have download this for my Kindle Fire and other android device.

#### 2, [Advanced Task Killer (ATK)](https://download.epubor.com/sold/ATKV2.1.3B213CT3.2U4.2ADMOB6.2.1DG.apk)

Advanced Task Killer is a very simple tool and often used to kill apps and clean memory. You can also go to the google play to download it.

 After the installation, tap the icon to open this tool and you can see all running applications listed on the screen. Uncheck some apps you don't want to kill (such as Advanced Task Killer and some system apps) Tap the button "Kill selected apps", it will kill all applications checked.

Different from the Es Task manager, you can kill all selected apps at one time. It's easy-to use for some lazy people. 

Although, task managers are a controversial subject in Android-land, but many people still choose to use them because it designed to improve the android devices' performance.

### Method 3: Close Apps Away

If you are using the new Amazon kindle, this is the easiest way to close kindle fire app.

Step 1\. Press the "square icon" located at the lower-right portion of the screen.

Step 2\. Swipe up and down to switch between apps.

Step 3\. Swipe the apps you wish to close off the screen to the right or tap the X in the upper-right corner of the app window.

![close apps away kindle fire](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/close-apps-away-kindle-fire-1.png)

This method only works on the newer kindle fire. If you are using the very old kindle fire, the above two methods are both working.

### Conclusion

Kill tasks, free memory, speed up phone, save battery life, you can do it now! If you have any better experience, you are welcome to share with us in the comments.

 This does not work. I really want to know how to kill a single at a time. I am using a new edition kindle fire 10" HD. It worked on the older devices but not using the current operating system. I am very disappointed to have read your entire article for no new info that is useful.
