EPub is one of the most popular e-book formats. But it's not widely used like PDF - a format which can be read almost on any platform and device. For people who have lots of ePub e-books, it's a pity that you can't read these books on Amazon Kindle or other devices which don't support ePub. It's necessary to convert the ePub e-books to PDF. This article will tell you how to convert ePub to PDF on Mac OS with three kinds of converters.

1 Epubor Ultimate for Mac

**Epubor Ultimate for Mac** is one of the best e-book converters. You can use it to convert ePub files to PDF easily. One of its important features is DRM removal. Any ePub files with Adobe DRM or Nook DRM can be decrypted. If your books are saved in the default path, it will detect and upload them automfatically. You can see the books under "ADE" or "Nook" icon. 

If they are not listed on the left side, we can simply click the "Add" button to add new ePub files or tap setting icon on the upper right corner to set your eBook path, then they will be loaded automatically. Simply drag them to the right main interface of this tool, their DRM can be removed the time they are added. You can add one more ePub e-books a time and it supports batch conversion. Set the output format as "PDF" and click the bulue "Convert" button and then you'll get new PDF files.
