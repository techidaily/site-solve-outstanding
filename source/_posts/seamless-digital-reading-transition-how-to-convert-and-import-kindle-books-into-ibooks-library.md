When I got my iPad not long ago, I was quite excited and thought I could read any ebooks freely on my iPad. But things were not that easy. After purchasing my ebooks from Amazon, I started to transfer kindle books to ibooks. But I failed, let alone to read them in ibooks. I got depressed. Later, I came to know that Amazon kindle books are protected from its unique DRM and the file formats are mainly kfx, mobi, azw and azw3 which are not supported by ibooks. Should I give up those Amazon kindle books? Of course not. I had paid for it . Besides, unfortunatelly I found the same books I wanted were not available in ibookstores after searching.

In order to read Amazon kindle books in ibooks successfully, I was told that I need a software which not only can remove the Amazon kindle DRM but also can convert the file formats.
