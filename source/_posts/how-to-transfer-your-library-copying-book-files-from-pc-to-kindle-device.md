### Part2\. Copy Kindle Books to Kindle From Computer

For kindle books, because of Amazon's account limitation, people cannot transfer or copy books freely. Thus, you can't own your kindle books truely or do what you want with your books such as sharing books with friends and family members. Neither can you copy books to kindle from computer. But don't worry, we have ways to solve this problem. 

1Download the needed tool for free.

The kindle books usually come with DRM. They cannot be copied unless they are decrypted. So removing drm protection from ebooks is the first step. Here I recommend [Epubor Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) for you. It's a powerful tool that can be used to remove DRM and convert ebook formats. Now you can download the program for free and use it to remove your books' DRM.

Continue to follow me, I'll show you how to copy your non-kindle books to kindle easily.

If you have already downloaded[epubor ultimate converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), you can use it directly now. If you haven't, I strongly recommend to download and install it now. It's really amazing, and it's free for you to download and use. So don't hesitate to have it!

1Remove DRM from books 

Open epubor ultimate, use it to remove DRM at first. The program can automatically find three kinds of ebooks, kindle, adobe digital editions and nook books. If your books are of either kind among the three, it will find your books by itself. The books will be listed in the right book column like kindle books too.

 You just need to drag them to the left part of the program's interface, their DRM will be removed immediately. The operating process is just the same with kindle books, If you have read the kindle books part of this article carefully, you will know clearly about what to do right? (Notice: remove adobe digital editions books, you should make sure the books such as epub books can be read normally on Adobe Digital Editions in your computer. Otherwise you cannot remove drm successfully and copy epub to kindle.) 

If you have other formats like PDF, you need to add the books by yourself. Click the "Add" button at the top left corner of the program's interface and choose your books to add to the program. Or you can drag the books to the left part of the program directly. This is easier and faster.When you add the books to the program, their DRM will be removed. There's no need of doing anything else manually. 

2Convert books to Kindle formats 

After removing DRM, you need to convert the non-kindle books' formats to those supported by kindle. Convert to mobi might be the best for reading. The decrypted books are listed in the left part of Ultimate Converter's interface. Set the output as mpbi, choose your decrypted books and click "Convert" button at the bottom right corner. The books will be converted to mobi books within seconds. 

3Copy non-kindle books to kindle 

Connect your kindle to computer using the micro- USB cable. You can transfer files from and to your Kindle just like it was an external hard drive. Double click the kindle drive, then you will see there is a "documents" folder in it. Then copy your converted mobi ebooks to the "documents" folder. Done. (Don't forget to hit the icon that says "remove hardware safely" or "remove Amazon kindle" on the lower part of your screen before you detach the USB cord from your computer.) Then restart your kindle, you will be able to read your coping books on it.

**Note:** If you purchase non-Kindle books from Kobo eBook store, you can also use **Kindle Transfer** mentioned above to copy them to your Kindle. This tool will automatically convert the eBook to Kindle supported formats during transmission.
