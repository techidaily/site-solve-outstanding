 I appreciate the straightforward ability the software provided me to ensure seamless control during a live cooking class. The simplicity felt so straight forward, all of the added features make it vital and of great value.

 I was most impressed with the ease of use, the seamless and straightforward integration ManyCam offers my Foundation. The very thorough walkthroughs and videos on the ManyCam site always point me in the right direction. It’s also really helpful for us to have a solid alternative to live fundraising events if ever we need to go virtual in the future.

New York State Court

 While it is not as critical for the jurors to see the witness clearly, jurors in the spectator area complained they could only see the back of the attorneys, who are facing the judge. To make the matter even more complicated, most of the courtroom does not have enough space to accommodate two monitors: one for spotlighting the witness, one for showing evidence. The Team overcame those challenges by installing cameras pointing at the counsel tables and using the ManyCam software on a Dell Precision workstation. It can create multiple layouts with a mix of video (witness, counsels, sometimes judge too) and content (evidence). The ManyCam software is also a virtual camera that has been used in Teams call for remote court appearance and streaming court proceedings for the press/public.

 I appreciate how Manycams is like a mini-production studio. What used to take a Tricaster/Video Toaster setup can now be done in software using a standard PC. I can switch back and forth between instructor view, demonstration camera, audience view, presentation slide deck or video, etc… and it is seamless. I can turn on lower-thirds to give context to a video or a speaker, and by running it through a virtual camera, it seamlessly plugs into almost any conference medium whether it's Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Blackboard, Adobe Connect, etc…. I can use regular consumer level webcams to create a ‘circular’ view for around the table discussions instead of purchasing expensive PTZ cameras for meetings, I can also facilitate an online conference with keynote speakers, panels, audience, etc… with simple inexpensive setups. In a nutshell, it really lets me show off the content without requiring expensive technology and having the technology control what can happen.
