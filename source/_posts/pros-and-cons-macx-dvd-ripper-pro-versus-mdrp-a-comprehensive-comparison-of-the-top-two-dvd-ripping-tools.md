People who frequently back up their DVD collections often mix up MacX DVD Ripper Pro with Mac DVDRipper Pro. They are two different products from two companies own very similar product names. Admittedly, MDRP is better known among users, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's better. In fact, they vary greatly in the design, built-in features, output options, and ripping performance. As so many users get confused with the two DVD rippers for Mac, a full review on MacX DVD Ripper Pro vs MDRP is necessary. 

_Note: Both Mac DVD rippers are designed to protect your DVD from scratches or damages, and make the DVD playable on your other devices. You can't use them for any illegal purpose._ 



## Basic Info

### MacX DVD Ripper Pro

 Developed by Digiarty Software, Inc. (MacXDVD), MacX DVD Ripper Pro works on both macOS and Windows to back up, rip and convert both commercial and homemade DVD, ISO image and TS folder into different video formats and mobile devices. It's available at $29.95\. 

**About the name:** Founded in 2006, the company was initially devoted exclusively to Windows-oriented product line branded as "WinX". In 2010, the company established the branch MacXDVD Software, Inc. to offer products for MacOS-based users. And MacX DVD Ripper Pro was released in August the same year. Many negative comments on MacX DVD Ripper Pro criticize it for fooling users into thinking of MDRP. In fact, it was named not only in an echo of the popular Windows-oriented flagship product of the company, WinX DVD Ripper Platinum but also in the company's determination to develop "pro" products with "macx" performance.

### MDRP (Mac DVDRipper Pro) 

 Developed by DVDSuki Software Inc., MDRP is a DVD ripper for macOS (10.8 or higher) to rip DVD to .dvdmedia or convert discs to M4V format. It will also remove the copy protection scheme imposed on most commercial DVDs. It's available at $24.95\. Information about the release date of MDRP is limited. As we find that the Version 1.6.4 was released on November 3, 2010, and the company is established in 2009, let's say MDRP was born in 2009.

## Ripping Performance

To ensure the fairness, we quote the comparison from the third site Macsoftreview ([check the article](https://www.macsoftreview.com/mac-dvdripper-pro-review/?tdsourcetag=s%5Fpcqq%5Faiomsg)) to show you the difference in DVD ripping speed between MacX DVD Ripper Pro and Mac DVDRipper Pro. The figure below indicates that MacX DVD Ripper Pro doubles the speed of MDRP.

![MacX DVD Ripper Pro vs Mac DVDRipper Pro speed](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-ripper-pro/article-image/drp-vs-mdrp.jpg)

For your reference, below we also provide the results of our internal speed test. In the test, we have compared the two macOS DVD rippers in different ripping modes with the same DVD movie. On the same computer configuration, MacX DVD Ripper Pro shows slim advantage over MDRP when converting DVD to H.264 and back up the full disc. The gap becomes wider in ripping DVD to H.265 as MacX DVD Ripper Pro supports GPU acceleration for both H.264 and H.265.

| |  rip and convert - h.264 | rip and convert - h.265 | full disc image - ISO | main movie |                       |

## FAQ about MacX DVD Ripper Pro 

**A. Can MacX DVD Ripper Pro deal with Blu-ray discs?**

No. Currently, it supports DVD, folder and ISO image only. The company has a plan for Blu-ray support in the near future.

[Check Official Fixes to MacX DVD Ripper Pro Errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

**B. MacX DVD Ripper Pro fails to open on my computer, what should I do?**

 MacX DVD Ripper Pro supports macOS 10.6-10.14\. Make sure you have updated to the latest version. If the problem continues, check if there are any newly-installed programs that may conflict with the ripper.

**C. The DVD ripper stops halfway without ripping the entire movie.**

 Enable the Safe Mode checkbox on the right bottom part of the interface and re-rip. The Safe Mode can solve most ripping problems like failure to open certain DVDs, several MB outputs, ripper crashes... 

**D. The subtitles are missing from the ripped movie.**

When the correct title is selected by the ripper, click the subtitle settings and you can see Track1 \[English\], Track2 \[German\], Track3 \[\]... Select the language you want or simply choose the Forced Subtitle option. Or try to copy the DVD to ISO image format, which will include all the video, subtitles, audio and other content. 

**E. Can I rip only a part of the DVD movie?**

When the titles are displayed in the software, there is an Edit button available. Click it and find the option Trim. By setting the exact Start and End Time, you can rip any part you want.

**F. I want to keep the best video quality, which mode should I choose?**

 Select DVD Backup > Full Title Copy to make an exact digital copy in ISO Image. However, you should know that making a full DVD copy in ISO image is always the slowest for most rippers, including MacX DVD Ripper Pro.

**G. How to speed up the DVD ripping?**

Basically, the process speed depends heavily on your computer hardware. Higher configuration means faster speed. But on a specific computer, there are things you can do:

 \* Enable the Hardware Encoder to apply Intel/AMD/Nvidia GPU acceleration when applicable.

\* Select the main title copy mode, which is able to convert the main movie into mpeg within 5 minutes on an advanced computer.

 \* Enable the Safe Mode checkbox to avoid any possible ripping errors.

\* Lower the output settings like the resolutions, bit rate, quality, etc. 

\* Close other apps during the ripping.
