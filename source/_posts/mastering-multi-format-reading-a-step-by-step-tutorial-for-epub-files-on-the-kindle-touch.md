You may have purchased some interesting EPUB books on the main online eBook store, like Kobo, Sony, Google and Nook. But you only have a Kindle touch in hand. So the question is, "Can Kindle touch read EPUB?" The answer is yes. But you can't directly open or read EPUB files on your Kindle touch, because Kindle touch does not support EPUB format. If you want to read EPUB files on your Kindle touch, the best way is to converting EPUB to Kindle format. In this article, I will tell you detailed information about reading EPUB on Kindle touch. 

### Convert EPUB to Kindle format

In order to read EPUB on Kindle touch, we need to convert EPUB to Kindle supported format, such as azw, mobi, prc, etc.. In this part, I will introduce 2 useful tools for you to convert epub to Kindle.

**Note:** You may have thought of jailbreaking your Kindle touch and installing the app on it to read your EPUB books. In fact, I don't recommend you to do that. Because it's a little complicated. You may need to spend quite a while figuring it out. If you want to read EPUB on Kindle touch, there is no better and easier way than converting EPUB to Kindle format.

#### **Convert EPUB to Kindle format with Calibre**

As an eBooks lover, you may have heard of the management tool-- Calibre. It's really a powerful freeware which can help you solve many eBook problems, including eBook format conversion. You can use it to convert EPUB to Kindle format.

First, download and install [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) on your computer. Run the tool and add your EPUB books to it to convert eBook format. You can click "Add books" to add the books or just drag EPUB files to the program. Then all of your added books will show up in the main interface of Calibre.

![add epub books to calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/added-epub-books-to-calibre.jpg)

Select all the books you need to convert. Then click "Convert books" icon on the top row of the software.

A window below will pop up, just choose mobi as your output format. Then click "OK" button to continue.

Then you will see a conversion process at the bottom right corner of the software. The jobs counter will turn into zero when it finishes.

You can right click the book, and select "Open containing folder" to see converted files after the conversion has been completed.

If you select all the books to open containing folder, it will pop up over one window which displays your converted EPUB files. Because each converted book is saved in a different folder. This will be very complicated when you need to convert many books and copy them to your Kindle touch.

**Note:** Calibre can only convert DRM-free eBooks format. If your EPUB files are DRM protected, it will show up following alert. So, you may need the next tool to deal with the problem.
