[QuickTime player](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) has the ability to crop video dimensions or crop video to square on Mac? I'm afraid not. Your Mac native QuickTime player like QuickTime 7 doesn't empower you to crop video footage or resize video file. Instead, you're required to upgrade to QuickTime Pro version ($30 charged) for cropping video frames on MacBook or iMac. 

Stay here and spend roughly 3 minutes here reading the complete guide on using QuickTime Pro to crop/resize video on Mac if you're a loyal fan to QT and have already updated to Pro version. Plus, more simple solutions are also shared here as a bonus to crop video frames with no charge (esp. friendly to budget-minded users).

## Part 1\. How to Crop Video in QuickTime Pro on Mac 

Before you utilize QuickTime Pro to do the cropping stuff, you need to know that you'd better make a mask file using Photoshop to tell QuickTime Pro how it's supposed to crop your video footage. Install Photoshop on your macOS if it's not there. Then, follow the steps below to begin resizing your video frame to highlight your desired frame.

### Step 1\. Make a Snapchat of your Specific Video Frame

Capture a snapchat of your specific video frame via QuickTime Pro. Open QT Pro on your Mac > choose Edit at the top menu of your Mac desktop > select Copy to copy the image of your video frame.

### Step 2\. Create a Mask File

Launch Photoshop on your Mac > opt for File > New > paste the video image you've copied before. 

Afterwards, choose "Rectangular Marquee Tool" under marquee tool zone to select the frame area you want to keep > fill the selected area with black color and use opposite color - white color to fill the space outside the black box. Finally, save the file in GIF or TIFF format.

**Note:** there are built-in crop presets to automatically crop the letterbox, remove the black bars off of a recording, keep original aspect ratio, or crop video Mac from [4:3 or 16:9](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), 1:1 etc to fit different displays. 

**Step 3:** Export the cropped video to desirable formats. This depends on how you want to use with the output video. Whether you want to play the video on iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Huawei, other mobiles, upload to social sites, save in cloud services, or stream to media servers, you can find a preset here.

### Clideo

**Note:** the online video resizer tool has strict limits on input file size. You can't successfully import video to Clideo unless your video file is less than 100MB. Or you've to upgrade to Premium version for larger-sized [(YouTube) video cropping](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

online video resizer tools are suitable for free cropping video in smaller size (within 100MB). Consider to upgrade to Premium version if your video footage is large (e.g., 500MB, 1GB) and you wanna protect your personal video file with the high-level security.
