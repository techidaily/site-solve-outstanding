### 1\. Use HEIC & HEVC

Since iOS 11, iPhone has introduced two new camera formats: HEIC and HEVC. Both the formats are designed to save 50% storage of the device at the same quality. In other words, with more space available using HEIC/HEVC compared to JPG/H264, your iPhone will be much faster. To speed up iPhone, don't forget to take photos in HEIC and record videos in HEVC. To enable the two new formats, go to Settings > Camera > Formats and choose High Efficiency.

### 2\. Close apps in background

Have a lot of [free apps on iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)? If you are running many apps in background, your iPhone will go sluggish, especially when you open a big app. By shutting down all the open apps, your iPhone goes faster and more smoothly. Follow the tips to [fix iPhone slowing down](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) issue as below if you are a newbie. 

**Step 1:** Double-click the Home button to bring up all the apps currently running in background. 

**Step 2:** Swipe upwards to turn off the apps. You can swipe upwards the apps one by one or swipe with up to three fingers. 

**Note:** There is **no Home button** on iPhone 8/Plus or iPhone X. To close apps in the background, follow the tip: use AssistiveTouch from Settings > General > Accessibility > turn on AssistiveTouch. Then return to iPhone mian interface to click AssistiveTouch icon > Device > More > click Multitasking. Followed by the above Step 2.

### 3\. Remove Videos, Photos, Songs, Other Files 

iPhone storage space is limited. If you like to [download movies to iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)or have stored many videos, photos, songs, etc. on iPhone, your iPhone may run slowly, especially on older iPhone models. It's advised to free up space to spare more available storage, at least 1GB to make iPhone faster. Follow the steps to make your iPhone run faster. 

* To delete music, open music app -> find the unwanted album, artist or track to be deleted -> Swipe to the right -> press Delete.
* To remove photos & videos, open the photos app -> find the images to be removed -> tap Select -> press the images you want to delete -> tap the bin icon -> confirm to delete the photos and videos you've chosen.

### 4\. Restart iPhone

If your older iPhone 6S/6/5S/4S/4 or even iPhone 7/8/X runs slowly, don't hesitate to restart it as some ungovernable apps can be wiped out and the storage will be extended via iPhone shutdown. So you can learn how to speed up your iPhone and even extend your memory space with the following steps:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Sleep button, which is on the right side of the older iPhones till the Power Off slider appears.

### 5\. Delete Unused Apps/Games

From time to time, you may forget about the apps or games you downloaded from Apple Store. The sad news is that the unused apps not only take up a lot of space but also consume the CPU resource of your iPhone, either because of background refresh, notifications, or something else, leading to slow iPhone response. Therefore, it's an essential way to speed up iPhone by getting rid of some apps and games you never use. 

**Step 1:** Just press the icon of the app or game you'd like to delete for few seconds until the apps wobble and the "X" icon on the top-left corner of the apps appear. 

**Step 2:** Click X icon to delete the app or game.

Or you can go to Settings -> General -> Usage -> Manage Storage where you can see which apps eat up the space memory and how much storage space is left. Then delete the unwanted apps. Frankly, 1GB space will be good to speed up iphone.

### 6\. Erase Old Text Messages & Junk Files 

Another reason resulting in slow iPhone response is the text message and call history. By removing the old text messages can relief your iPhone memory to some extent, though this won't free up much space for your iPhone. But if the threads do contain images, videos and voice notes, you can get rid of them right away to make iPhone faster. 

**Step 1:** Open the Settings app -> Messages menu and scroll to the bottom.

**Step 2:** Change the expiry of video and voice messages to "After 2 minutes". Two minutes later, the messages you receive or send will be deleted. 

**Note:** Have no habit to delete iPhone old messages regularly? No bother. Another **iOS 16 new feature** will serve you.  
**1.** Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Enable Auto Delete Old Conversations to remove old messages after a year.  
**2.** Go to Settings > General > Message > Keep Messages > Select 1 Year >**Enable Auto Delete Old Conversations**.

### 3\. Upgrade iPhone to the Latest iOS or Not

A big iOS update means a faster performance on iPhone or iPad. So updating iPhone to latest iOS can speed up iPhone to some extent. To update iOS 16, just go to Settings -> General -> Software Update. But there are exceptions that we don't suggest you updating software for iPhone speed boost: 

**1\. iOS problems.** 

Psychologically, older phone seems to be slower compared to newer ones. But the real iPhone slowness correlation is that newer iOS is synchronous with newer iPhone models and each iOS updates tend to make older hardware run slower. The typical examples are the iOS 17\. One of the big problems with iOS update is the huge memory consumption, leading to insufficient space for other tasks and slow iPhone performance. In this case, you'd better to wait until the iOS is stable and then upgrade to the new iOS to fix the bugs. As to the lateset iOS, a controversial decision is made by Apple to ensure there is no unexpected shut down of the older phones at the expense of slowing iPhone's processing power. 

**2\. Incompatibility.** 

Each iOS update means incompatibility with elder iDevice models. For instance, the iPhone 6S/7 and earlier models are incompatible with iOS 16 upgrade. Whilst users of older iPhone 6S or older models won't enjoy the privilege of new iOS for iPhone speedup. 

**3\. iOS power consumption.** 

Bear in mind, iOS 17 brings you a lot of amazing features and generally gives iPhone a boost in speed though, more and more power is required to run it to fight against the sluggish performance on iPhone iPad. That's why the new iPhone has faster processor than the predecessors. But for the older model like iPhone 8 or below, updating to iOS 17 will actually slow it down, because it struggles to run the demanding iOS. If you report the iPhone slow problem after updating to iOS 17, please downgrade iOS 17 to iOS 16, which will somehow speed up iPhone.

### 4\. Restore iPhone from iTunes Backup 

Resorting iPhone from iTunes backup is favor of iPhone speedup. If iOS upgrade is not what you are willing to, you can restore iPhone from an iTunes backup. 

Step 1: Plug the iPhone into Mac and open iTunes.   
 Step 2: Click the iPhone and tap Restore Backupâ€¦ under Backups. Or you can click Back Up Now button next door if you need to backup iPhone into iTunes. 

Note: You are suggested to backup iPhone data first (better have a backup than need a backup) as this will undo all the changes you made on iPhone. And you an check the troubleshooting guide of [iPhone won't restore from backup](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) if your iPhone fails to restore from iTunes backup.

### 5\. Reset iPhone Settings & Full Reset

Your ancient iPhone speed boost can also rely on some iPhone settings. There are several speed tips to accelerate slow iPhone by tweaking Phone settings.

**1\. Turn down graphics for iOS users only.** 

Step 1: Tap on Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion and set Reduce Motion to On so as to turn off the parallax effect of icons and alerts, thereby increasing iPhone speed.   
 Step 2: Tap on Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast and set Reduce Transparency to On so as to disable the background effects, thereby speeding up iPhone, specially on Control Centre. 

**2\. Reset iPhone to Factory Settings** 

 One trump card to solve the problem of sluggish iPhone is to resort to a full reset and return your iPhone to the factory default condition.   
 Step 1: Go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.   
 Step 2: Enter the passcode and confirm to delete all media and data.   
 Step 3: Reset all settings. 

**Note**: The full reset (aka restore to factory settings) is a double-edged sword, which, on the one hand, speed up iPhone drastically, on the other hand, deletes all the data and media, including messages, contacts, photos, music, videos, etc. So please make sure to have [backup iPhone to Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), iTunes, iCloud or other cloud storage before [resetting iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
